# Kayak_app
Find the best destination and hotels


# The Project
The marketing team needs help on a new project. After doing some user research, the team discovered that 70% of their users who are planning a trip would like to have more information about the destination they are going to.

In addition, user research shows that people tend to be defiant about the information they are reading if they don't know the brand which produced the content.

Therefore, Kayak Marketing Team would like to create an application that will recommend where people should plan their next holidays. The application should be based on real data about:

- Weather
- Hotels in the area

**The application is able to recommend the best destinations and hotels based on the above variables at any given time.**

## Deliverables:
- A .csv file in files/ and an S3 bucket containing enriched information about weather and hotels for each french city

- A SQL Database where we should be able to get from S3

- A maps where you should have a Top-5 destinations and a Top-20 hotels in the area
